Disease,Description
Flea Allergies,"Flea allergy dermatitis is an immunologic disease caused by the injection of antigens from the salivary glands of fleas as they feed on the host animal. Flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) or flea bite hypersensitivity is the most common dermatologic disease of domestic dogs in the US."
Food Allergies,"Ten percent of all allergy cases in dogs are food allergies. Dogs also can suffer from food intolerance, which is different from a food allergy. It’s a genetic problem, and when it’s triggered, it’s by exposure to whatever they’re allergic to. The most common allergens are beef, dairy, wheat, egg, chicken, lamb, soy, pork, rabbit, and fish. And, most dogs are usually allergic to more than one thing."
Skin Allergies,"Skin allergies are also referred to as allergic dermatitis, and they are the most common types of allergies in dogs. Your pup may be allergic to any number of irritants that are causing him or her to itch, scratch, and become generally uncomfortable."
Arthritis,"Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints and is a common problem for many dogs, causing pain, discomfort, and stiffness. In dogs with arthritis, cartilage within a joint (hip, elbow, etc.) changes or becomes damaged, making it less smooth and causing the bones in the joint to rub together."
Bladder Stones,"Bladder stones (uroliths or cystic calculi) are rock-like formations of minerals that develop in the urinary bladder. There may be a large, single stone or a collection of stones that range in size from sand-like grains to gravel. It is common for a mixture of both small and large stones to be present."
Bloating,"Bloat happens when a dog's stomach fills with gas, food, or fluid, making it expand. The stomach puts pressure on other organs. It can cause dangerous problems, including decreased blood flow to their heart and stomach lining, a tear in the wall of their stomach, a harder time breathing."
Bone Cancer,"Bone Cancer or Hemangiosarcomas are malignant tumors derived from the cells lining blood vessels (hem = blood, angio = vessel, sarcoma = tumor). Hemangiosarcoma is a common cancer in dogs accounting for approximately 5% of cases. Since blood vessels run throughout the body, hemangiosarcomas can develop anywhere."
Bronchitis,"Canine chronic bronchitis is characterized by daily coughing that lasts longer than one month. A cough may be mistaken for the sound of vomiting and is often followed by retching and wheezing. Dogs may also display lethargic behavior as a result of excessive mucus build-up causing airway obstruction."
Cysts,"Cysts are hollow spaces within tissues that contain either liquid or solidified materials; the contents may be made up of natural bodily secretions (e.g., sebum – the oily waxy substance secreted by the sebaceous glands – or sweat) or abnormal breakdown products such as dead cells or keratin."
Distemper,"Distemper is a highly contagious viral disease of domestic dogs and other animals such as ferrets, skunks, and raccoons. It is an incurable, often fatal, multisystemic (affecting multiple organs) disease that affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems."
Dental Disease,"Periodontal Disease a.k.a dental disease in dogs is caused by the build-up of plaque and tartar on the teeth, which can lead to gum infections, bone loss, loss of teeth, and other serious health problems. Diligent at-home dental care, along with regular dental checkups by your vet, can keep your dog's mouth healthy."
Ear Infection,"The cause for most dog ear infections is either yeast or bacteria that’s trapped in the ears. Yet, ear mites, wax buildup, or allergies can also cause painful ear infections in dogs."
Eye Infection,"Eye discharge is a common problem for some dogs. It can be a sign of anything from infection to glaucoma to allergies. If your dog has clear eye discharge, chances are good it's caused by allergies or something physical, like dust in the eye or wind blowing in the face. A watery discharge or mucus from one eye is often a sign of a foreign body, like an eyelash, while yellow-green or pus-like eye discharge could indicate a serious infection."
Fecal Impaction,"Fecal impaction in dogs is a condition where very hard and dry stools collect in the rectum or colon. The affected dog is unable to pass the stools as normal. Common causes include not drinking enough water or eating an inappropriate diet. All dogs can suffer from this condition, but elderly canines often have more frequent digestion-related problems."
Fractures,"Fractures occur commonly in both dogs and cats. While typically fractures occur after a traumatic incident, such as being hit by a car or falling from a height, some fractures occur following a pathologic weakening of the bone, which is seen with certain neoplastic conditions, such as osteosarcoma."
Gastiris,"Gastritis is a general term used to describe a syndrome of acute or chronic vomiting secondary to inflammation of the gastric mucosa. Irritation, infection, antigenic stimulation, or injury (eg, chemical, erosion, ulceration) of the gastric mucosa stimulates the release of inflammatory and vasoactive mediators with subsequent disruption of gastric epithelial cells, increased gastric acid secretion, and impaired gastric barrier function."
Head Injury,"Concussions are the most common form of head trauma in dogs. Generally, dogs make a full recovery from a concussion, but delayed treatment or extreme head trauma can lead to a concussion-causing permanent brain damage. Dogs can also have brain bleeding and swelling."
Heat Stroke,"Heat stroke is a term commonly used for hyperthermia or elevated body temperature. Generally speaking, if a pet's body temperature exceeds 103°F (39.4°C), it is considered abnormal or hyperthermic. Body temperatures above 106°F (41°F) without previous signs of illness are most commonly associated with exposure to excessive external or environmental heat and are often referred to as heat stroke."
Herpes,"Canine herpesvirus or canine herpes is a systemic, often fatal disease of puppies caused by canine herpes virus (CHV). CHV is seen most commonly in Asia and Europe in dogs, coyotes, and wolves. The most common clinical signs occur in puppies under four weeks of age. Litter mortality (death) rates are high in CHV. In puppies, clinical signs include difficulty breathing, a thick nasal discharge, loss of appetite (anorexia), grayish yellow or green soft, odorless stools, persistent crying, seizures, and sudden death."
Hip Dysplasia,"Hip dysplasia is a deformity of the hip that occurs during growth. The hip joint is a ball and socket joint. During growth, both the ball (the head of the femur, or thighbone) and the socket in the pelvis (acetabulum) must grow at equal rates. In hip dysplasia, this uniform growth during puppyhood does not occur."
IBD(inflamatory bowl disease),"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition in which your dog's intestine or digestive tract becomes inflamed consistently. The continuing inflammation damages the lining of their digestive tract in a way that prevents food from being properly digested. It can also lead to other health problems if nutrients are not absorbed as they should be."
Urinary Incontinence,"Urinary incontinence is when your dog involuntarily loses control of their bladder. This can occur across a range of severity, from small leaks to large amounts of urine. Incontinence is a separate issue from behavior-related urination problems. Incontinence is usually caused by a medical condition, and your dog probably isn't aware it's happening."
Liver Disease,"The early signs of liver disease in dogs are nonspecific. They include loss of appetite, weight loss, and chronic intermittent vomiting and diarrhea. Vomiting is more common than diarrhea. Drinking and urinating more often than normal may be the first signs and the principal reason for seeking medical attention."
